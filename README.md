## Features

- **Production-Ready**: Built with enterprise-grade stability in mind.
- **Robust SSE Transport**: Efficiently stream data from server to client.
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error management to ensure smooth operation.
- **Built-in Tools**: Includes tools to facilitate development and deployment.
- **Seamless Integration**: Connect AI models to various data sources effortlessly.

## Getting Started

To get started with the MCP Boilerplate, you need to set up your development environment. Follow the steps below to get everything up and running.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 14 or higher)
- npm (Node package manager)
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.)

## Installation

To install the MCP Boilerplate, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/milxxyzxc/mcp-boilerplate.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd mcp-boilerplate
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

Now, your MCP server should be running locally. 

## Usage

Once the server is running, you can interact with it through various endpoints. The main functionalities include:

- **Connecting AI Models**: You can connect your AI models using the Model Context Protocol.
- **Streaming Data**: Use the SSE transport to stream data in real-time.
- **Error Reporting**: The server provides detailed error messages for easier debugging.

### Example

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to connect an AI model:

```javascript
const modelContext = require('mcp-boilerplate');

// Connect your model
modelContext.connect('your-model-id', {
    dataSource: 'your-data-source'
});
```

## Configuration

You can configure the MCP server by modifying the `config.json` file in the root directory. Here are some key settings:

- **port**: The port on which the server will run.
- **logLevel**: The level of logging (e.g., 'info', 'debug').
- **models**: An array of AI models to connect.

Example `config.json`:

```json
{
    "port": 3000,
    "logLevel": "info",
    "models": [
        {
            "id": "model1",
            "dataSource": "data-source-1"
        }
    ]
}
```
